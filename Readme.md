# CT

**(Relatively) Easy Unit Testing for C**

## How to use

1. Copy subdirectory `ct` into your project.
2. Add some rules to your makefile. See [Makefile][] for an example.
3. Write some tests. See [msg-test.c][] for an example.
   Test functions are those whose names begin with "cttest".
   The test runner forks before each test, so global state
   from one test will not affect another.
4. Run `make check`

##Setup and Teardown

Optionally, you can define a function named "ctsetup" in your test file. It
will run before each of the tests in that file. This function should expect no
arguments and return void. Each test file has the option to define its own setup function.

You can also define a function named "ctteardown"; it is the same as ctsetup,
except ctteardown runs after each test in the same file.

## Terminal Output

Running `make check` in the example supplied looks like this:

```
~/Projects/ct[master]: make check
cc -Werror -Wall   -c -o msg-test.o msg-test.c
ct/gen msg-test.o > ct/_ctcheck.c.part
mv ct/_ctcheck.c.part ct/_ctcheck.c
cc -Werror -Wall   -c -o ct/_ctcheck.o ct/_ctcheck.c
cc -Werror -Wall   -c -o ct/ct.o ct/ct.c
cc -Werror -Wall   -c -o msg.o msg.c
cc   ct/_ctcheck.o ct/ct.o msg.o msg-test.o   -o ct/_ctcheck
ct/_ctcheck
